# Project - Simple blogg

A very simple blogg, all you need to do is connect it to a database, all the tables will be created automatically. Then you just register your admin account and your good to go.

__This project was an assigment in a PHP Course during my University Studies, the language in the project is therefore in Swedish.__


## Architecture

The project is built with MVC-pattern, controllers gets instantiated, talks to the model, renders the view and pass along the necessary data. It uses apache rewrite rules to get _pretty urls_.

In an architecture standpoint there's room for improvement, I might return to this project and update it in the future to improve the overall architecture and to make better use of design patterns.
